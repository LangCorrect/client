# Community Guidelines

LangCorrect is filled with awesome people who have a passion for knowledge and languages. It's important to remember that we are a global community and that we won't necessarily share the same opinions and beliefs that you do. We want every one of our members to feel welcome and safe. So, please be polite and respectful in your interactions with other members.

- Please consider the language ability of the user with whom you are interacting.
- Please use this service for language learning.
- Please use proper spelling and grammar (unless the author of the journal has asked otherwise).
- Please use the voting system (thumbs up) to mark good corrections.
- Please use the reporting system to report spam, malicious corrections, comments, or users who are not abiding by the rules.
- Please remember that language learning is also about having fun and making new friends.
