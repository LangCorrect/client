## What data do we collect?

LangCorrect collects the following data:

-   Account Information - When you create an account for LangCorrect, we ask you to provide information such as your name, email, password, and native/studying languages. After the account is created and verified, you have the ability to add your name (only viewable to us) and a biography (viewable to everyone on your profile page).
-   User Content - We allow you to upload the following to our servers: journal posts, messages, comments, and other information.
-   Support - If you contact us for assistance, we may ask you to provide information such as your name, contact information as well as the nature of your query.

Please make sure that any personal information that you have provided us with is accurate and current. We will use this information to send you important information relating to your account.

## How do we collect your data?

You directly provide us with most of the data we collect. We collect and process data when you:

-   Register online or place an order for any of our products or services
-   Voluntarily complete a customer survey or provide feedback on any of our message boards or via email
-   Use or view our website via your browser’s cookies
-   We also collect any information you provide us when you write a message, journal, etc. (see user content above)

## How will we use your data?

LangCorrect collects your data so that we can process your order and manage your account (ex: account recovery).

## How do we store your data?

We store your personal data securely at a data center located in San Francisco, California. Your account password is securely encrypted with Industry standards (PBKDF2 algorithm with a SHA256 hash). In the future we plan on adding additional account security features such as two-step verification.

Please remember to keep your password safe and under no circumstances should you provide it to anyone else (we will never ask you for your password). We recommend using a password manager to easily create a strong password. Keep in mind that there is no service that is 100% secure. Banks, large corporations, governments and many others have all been breached before. With this in mind, we recommend (as an additional security measure) that you do not use a password that you have used elsewhere. In case you are not aware, there is a pretty awesome website (https://haveibeenpwned.com/) where you can periodically check if your account information has been compromised in a data breach.

## Marketing

We may send you information about premium features for LangCorrect.
